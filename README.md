# Welcome!

This simple REACTjs project is to learn the independency of RestfulAPI services. I created this simple Note APP in React to learn the connection to extern API Ruby on Rails (https://github.com/Kryptha/Note-API). I will also use this Note APP to work on the front-end with ReactJS with future new features. 

# Technologies

* React 18.2.0
* Javascript
* TailwindCSS 3.2.4
* Back-end: Note-API with RoR 7
